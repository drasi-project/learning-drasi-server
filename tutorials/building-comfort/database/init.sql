-- Building Comfort Tutorial Database Schema
--
-- Models a smart building as Building -> Floor -> Room. Each Room carries
-- temperature, humidity and co2 sensor readings. Table names are quoted and
-- PascalCase ("Building", "Floor", "Room") so that the node labels Drasi sees
-- match the Cypher continuous queries (which use (r:Room), (f:Floor),
-- (b:Building)) without any change to the query text.

-- Suppress noisy output during setup.
